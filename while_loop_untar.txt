//This snippet of code shows how to:
//1. un tar multiple files in a loop  and
//2. move the untarred files in a different name 

#!/bin/sh
X=1
Y=10
while [ $X -lt $Y ]
do
    cd /home/..../untar_files/  #goes to the folder saved for untarred files
    tar -xvf $X.tar       #untars the files X.tar to folder name LOGS (LOGS was the original name of folder)
    mv LOGS LOGS_$X           #each tarred folder X.tar was originally named 'LOGS', so while untarring it is moved to a different name
(( X+=1 ))
done
