//This snippet of code shows how to find and replace text from multiple files at once using 'sed' command.
//syntax: sed  's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt
//syntax: sed  'l s/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt
//s-> substitute command of sed for find and replace
//'/g' is global replace, and tells to find all occurence of 'old-text' and replaces them to 'new-text'
// '/g' can be replaced with for example '/1', '/2', which will now look for first occurence and second occurence as above
//if nothing mentioned at the end, only first occurence is replaced (equivalent to '/1')
//in the second syntax, 'l' represents the line in input.txt file where you want the replacement

//Here, in the example shown, there are multiple changes to be made in the original file 'my_file'
//Thus, I create intermediate files (inter1, inter2, inter3, inter4) which each change until the final change is made
//Once the final change is made, I will remove all the intermediate files inter1, inter2, inter3 and original file i.e. 'my_file'
//final file with all the changes made will then be moved to 'my_file_final'

sed 'l1 s/old_text1/new_text1/' my_file > inter1    #make change in file 'my_file' and save it to 'inter1'

sed 'l2 s/old_text2/new_text2/' inter1 > inter2     #make change in file 'inter1' and save it to 'inter2'
