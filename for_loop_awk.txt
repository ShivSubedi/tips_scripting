//This section of code shows:
//1. how to use for loop in scripting
//2. how to use awk command while adding data in single file from multiple data files

#!/bin/sh
for (( j = 1; j <=n; j++ )) //#n-> total number of profile.data files

 do
   #awk command below selects the 'a'th row and prints the value of 'b'th column from 'n' profile.data files
   #double ">" adds in each new entry in the data file specified.
 awk 'NR==a{print $b}'  profile$j.data >> new_file.data
done
