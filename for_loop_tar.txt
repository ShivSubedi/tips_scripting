//This snippet of code shows how to:
//1. tar multiple files in a loop remotely and
//2. move the tar files in a different location

#!/bin/sh
X=1
Y=10
while [ $X -lt $Y ]
do
cd /users/.../$X               #move to the folder X, which changes in loop from 1-10
tar -cvf $X.tar LOGS             #each folder X contains directory 'LOGS', which gets 'tar' into folder 'X.tar' in loop
mv $X.tar /users/.../tar_files     #each tar files are then moved to a different folder 'tar_files'
(( X+=1 ))
done
